# The Odin Project - Landing Page

This is one of the project about creating a landing page from `The Odin Project's` Foundations course.
As it is a landing page, it contains a `header`, `footer`, and `one or more sections` in between the header and footer.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to familiarize with the `flexbox` CSS property or layout by creating a landing page with the topics that have been covered so far.
